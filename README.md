## Weatherr

**A mimimalistic weather app.**

The app shows current weather in requested city. It supports request forms like:

- city - _example: London_
- city, country code - _example: London, UK_
- zip code - _example: 101000_

It also supports English and Russian languages

**Try it on [GitHub pages](https://mefistodevelop.github.io/weatherr/)**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**I also used:**

- Redux, react-redux, redux-thunk for work with state
- axios for work with rest-api
- eslint and airbnb's style guide
- hooks
- [openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
